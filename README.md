# Martian Rover

A hackathon project built at Treehacks 2021. This environment is used as a toy example of a dynamic environment for RL agents (changing wind conditions).
To play the game (inside the env directory):

```
python martian_rover_game.py
```

To simulate an episode:

```
python martian_rover_env.py
```

# Future Work

Train an agent.
